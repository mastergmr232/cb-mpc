**Task: Codebase Structure, Data Flow, and Security Posture Contextualization for Advanced LLM Analysis**

You are an AI codebase analysis agent ("Agent Codex"). Your objective is to perform a **thorough preliminary analysis of the provided codebase**. The information you gather will be provided as essential context to a separate, advanced AI language model (like Gemini) which will then conduct a deep security vulnerability assessment.

Your goal is to **extract and structure information that would be most valuable for an LLM to understand the codebase's architecture, data handling, potential attack surfaces, and areas of security sensitivity, without yourself performing dynamic execution or finding specific exploits.** Focus on mapping the "what" and "how" from the code structure itself.

**Core Instructions for "Agent Codex":**

1.  **Overall Structure & Technology Stack Identification:**
    *   Identify primary programming language(s), major frameworks, significant libraries, and dependencies (from manifest files like `pom.xml`, `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, etc.).
    *   Determine the likely application type(s) (web app, API, CLI, library).
    *   Identify build systems and package managers.

2.  **Module and Component Inter-relationship Mapping:**
    *   Identify distinct modules, services, or major functional components.
    *   **Crucially, map out dependencies and call relationships between these components at a high level.** (e.g., "Module A (in `src/moduleA/`) appears to import and use functions from Module B (in `lib/moduleB/`). Service X defined in `docker-compose.yml` likely communicates with Service Y over an internal API defined in `serviceX/api/client.py`.")
    *   Illustrate data flow paths between key components if evident from code structure or configuration.

3.  **Entry Point Identification & Input Handling Characterization:**
    *   List all probable primary entry points for external data or user interaction (e.g., HTTP route handlers, API endpoint definitions, CLI argument parsers, public functions in libraries, message queue consumers).
    *   For each entry point, describe:
        *   The type of input expected (e.g., JSON payload, URL parameters, file upload, command-line arguments).
        *   The initial data validation or sanitization routines, if any are apparent from the code structure near the entry point.
        *   Key functions or modules immediately involved in processing this input.

4.  **Data Storage & Sensitive Data Locus Identification:**
    *   Identify how and where the application stores persistent data (e.g., database types inferred from ORM usage or connection strings, file storage locations, caches).
    *   Pinpoint code sections or modules that appear to handle, process, or store potentially sensitive information (e.g., PII, credentials, financial data, secrets, cryptographic keys). List the relevant file paths.

5.  **Authentication, Authorization, and Session Management Mechanisms:**
    *   Locate and describe the primary mechanisms for user authentication (e.g., password handling, token generation/validation, SSO integration).
    *   Identify how authorization and access control are implemented (e.g., role checks, permission systems, decorators, middleware).
    *   Describe session management techniques if used (e.g., cookie handling, session storage).

6.  **Security-Relevant Configurations & Code Patterns:**
    *   Identify key configuration files and parameters related to security (e.g., CSP headers, CORS settings, TLS configurations, rate limiting, secret management).
    *   Note any use of potentially dangerous functions or patterns that warrant close inspection by a security-focused LLM (e.g., `eval()`, `exec()`, raw SQL, insecure deserialization libraries, use of known vulnerable library versions if discernible from manifests).
    *   Identify any custom cryptography implementations or unusual uses of standard crypto libraries.

7.  **External Service Interactions & Trust Boundaries:**
    *   List all explicit interactions with external services or APIs (e.g., payment gateways, cloud services, third-party data providers).
    *   Describe the trust assumptions made about data received from these external services.

**Reporting Requirements for "Agent Codex" (to be maximally useful for Gemini):**

Produce a **detailed, structured, and evidence-backed report** (referencing specific file paths and code snippets where appropriate). The report should enable an LLM (Gemini) to quickly grasp the security posture and critical areas of the codebase.

*   **1. Executive Summary:** Brief overview of the codebase, its purpose, primary technologies, and a summary of the most critical areas an LLM should focus on for security vulnerabilities.
*   **2. Architecture Overview:**
    *   Languages, frameworks, major dependencies.
    *   Component breakdown and high-level inter-component data/control flow diagram (can be textual description if diagrams aren't possible).
*   **3. Data Entry & Processing:**
    *   Table of identified entry points: (Path/Function | Input Type | Initial Processing Modules/Functions | Apparent Sanitization).
*   **4. Data Storage & Sensitive Data Handling:**
    *   Description of data persistence mechanisms.
    *   List of files/modules suspected of handling sensitive data, with brief rationale.
*   **5. Security Mechanisms:**
    *   Summary of AuthN, AuthZ, and session management approaches.
    *   List of security-related configuration parameters and their locations.
*   **6. Areas of Potential Concern & "Interesting" Code Sections for LLM Review:**
    *   List specific files, functions, or modules that exhibit characteristics suggesting higher security risk (e.g., complex input parsing, direct system calls, handling of untrusted data before security checks, custom security logic).
    *   **For each area, briefly explain *why* it's of interest for a deeper LLM security review.** (e.g., "`src/utils/file_processor.py`: Processes user-uploaded files with custom parsing logic, potential for path traversal or parser vulnerabilities.")
    *   List any observed uses of known dangerous functions/patterns.
*   **7. External Dependencies & Trust Boundaries:**
    *   List external service integrations and the nature of the data exchanged.

**"Agent Codex" Instructions for Output:**
*   Provide this report in a clear, machine-readable format if possible (e.g., structured Markdown), but human-readable text is primary.
*   Focus on extracting facts from the code and avoid speculation beyond what the code structure strongly implies.
*   The goal is to arm the subsequent LLM (Gemini) with the best possible starting context.

Only focus on actual code files, not configuraiton files or setup scripts.
